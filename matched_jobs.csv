• Ability to navigate ambiguity, manage competing priorities, and drive execution in dynamic environments, while taking ownership and identifying key opportunities for organizational transformation.
• Excellent analytical, problem-solving, and organizational skills, with a consultative approach.
• Strong ability to prioritize, assess risks, and evaluate trade-offs to drive optimal outcomes.
• Understanding of technical architecture, data delivery, and integration, with familiarity in modern programming languages.
• Effective verbal and written communication skills, with the ability to engage across all levels, including technical and non-technical stakeholders.

"['health_insurance', 'paid_time_off', 'dental_coverage']",Trunk Tools,"At Trunk Tools, we are tackling the massive $13 trillion+ construction industry. We’re an exceptional team of serial entrepreneurs, brought together by our shared mission: automating construction. Our founding team (SpaceX, Stanford, MIT, Carta, etc.) has successfully built and deployed software in construction for 140k+ users, millions of users beyond the construction space, and worked on +$2 billion of built-environment projects. We aren’t another out-of-touch tech startup, most of our team comes from construction.

We spent the last few years building the brain behind construction. Now we are deploying workflows/agents, starting with Q&A document chatbot, to be ingrained in construction teams’ workflows, ultimately to automate construction. Given our immense traction with several Fortune 500 construction companies, we are doubling our team (currently 45 FTE) in order to deploy several more agents this year. You will have an opportunity to drive the transformation of a multi-trillion-dollar industry full of waste, risks and inefficiencies.

The Product Manager will assume responsibility for the development of the Trunk Tools’ AI platform for construction, leveraging deep experience in building B2B software businesses. The PM will work closely with Engineering, Product Design, Subject Matter Experts/Advisors, Sales, Marketing, Ops, Implementations, and Customer Support in the design, development, iteration, and launch of Trunk Tools’ products, which improve productivity for the deskless workforce across their organization. The Product Manager will contribute to the development of our AI products, including identifying business opportunities, conducting discovery, advocating for priorities that balance business and customer objectives, tracking progress against success metrics, managing delivery risks, and keeping stakeholders informed. As a PM, you are responsible for our product’s commercial success and will drive its growth, value, and adoption.

Product Managers at Trunk Tools are customer-centric, master influencers, and technologically fluent. They know how to get the right people and resources in the room to deliver. In addition to impacting customers through skillful interpersonal communication, we are looking for a strategic thinker who is interested in improving processes and pursuing initiatives to help our team continually grow and provide the best products to customers. This position reports directly to the VP of Product.

What you'll be doing:
• Serve as the voice of the customer by conducting regular, structured discovery sessions with customers and prospects, organizing the information to inform your strategic recommendations around prioritization.
• Manage internal and external expectations around priorities and delivery timelines, using roadmaps to visually stimulate conversation about what we should build and why to deliver which outcomes (Engineering is responsible for delivery plans, but you will communicate what they are and if/how/why they have changed).
• Constantly advocate for the good of the business in every interaction and decision, tempering emotions, pressure, and even personal preference to be as objective as possible.
• Collaborate with Implementations, Sales, Marketing, and Ops to ensure a smooth and successful customer experience with any new launch or product iteration.
• Contribute to our scale efforts by establishing and improving our SDLC processes and contributing to best practices.
• Own the processes and tooling to ensure critical data is being captured around customer usage, activity, and adoption.
• Provide consistent feedback to Sales, Marketing, and Implementations to constantly optimize customer expectation management, communication, onboarding, training, and stabilization.
• Enhance the company’s outreach by coordinating/participating in activities such as webinars, conferences, and other opportunities.
• Work with the VP of Product to continue to level up SDLC at Trunk Tools to optimize for data-driven decision making, achieving desired business outcomes, and amplifying the voice of the customer to internal stakeholders.

Qualifications
• 5+ years as a B2B SaaS Product Manager, preferably with AI and LLM experience for business applications. Experience with construction/real estate technology desired but not required.
• You have experience both maturing existing products and incubating new ones from 0 to 1.
• You are a persuasive, results driven influencer with outstanding interpersonal skills.
• You’re an exceptional verbal and written communicator.
• You are able to partner effectively with C-Suite, VP, and Director-level contacts, along with day-to-day users of the software.
• You are a team player who can work effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals. You are skilled at collaborating with diverse teams.
• You can learn and drive outcomes with minimal supervision.
• You have a bias towards action, and gravitate towards environments where you have outsized influence on the success of outcomes for customers and colleagues.
• You have a strong sense of empathy and a desire to improve the lives of those who work in the built world.
• You are fascinated by technology, artificial intelligence, and the impact these things have on the world we live in.
• You have experience working in JIRA to manage the SDLC in a SOC2 Type II environment.
• CSPO and CSM certifications are desired but not required.
• Must be located in a US time zone (and US or Canada only - must be able to travel to the US).
